     History is a tricky discipline that can cloud or distort our understanding of the past. The breadth, depth and complexity of human society and our overarching narratives stem from the future renderings of the current social status quo. As a result, one decides who participates in the historical records and how those stories are preserved. </br></br> 
      The work I’m showing uses Artificial Intelligence to create new visual artworks based on the work of female artists who have been active mainly before the 20th Century. This is an effort to rearticulate the historical narrative through the possibilities given by current technology. I explore the potential of this generative system to tell a story, pay tribute to a little-known or forgotten artist from the past and create a Speculative Salon 1.0. I use this analogy of inclusivity and style to articulate another story. Like the Salon’s alternatives which generally derived from the rejection by the academy’s traditional taste and forcing the forward-thinking artist to take the exhibition of their work into their hands, I make another alternative iteration of the Salon through the perspective of the now. It spans different generations and artists from other localities. In that sense, it is the possibilities given by the technology to bypass the limitation of time and distance, to stretch and compress it, and to explore what could have possibly happened if Artemisia Gentileschi and Natalia Goncharova or Berthe Morisot and Bessie Davidson were contemporaries.</br>
     I further question the widespread opinion among creatives and the general audience that art is a process by which ideas are expressed through personal experience rather than using knowledge databases as mechanisms of collective memory facilitated by computers. Implementing AI technology can question what art is whilst being a mirror for humans. It can redefine and expand on the traditional boundaries of art-making by reflecting the perceptions, preconceptions and contradictions characterising our existence in the world. </br>
     The output of this process is, as the name suggests, work based on speculation of artists’ collaboration and an evolving online archive. It uses images of their artistic production as a starting point. These collaborations are intergenerational and intercontinental and go beyond class, societal status, and aspects of inclusivity. Thus AI would allow time travel as a shift between the past and an imagined future. </br></br>
 The idea of emergency reflects an urgency that is both a moment in time and an emotional state and reflects a necessity. I situate the project within the context of the theme by creating work that demonstrates this urgency and asks how we can talk about the representation of women in the art world through art by avoiding didactic and moral practices and creating new space for sustainable ones. In this space, we make the conditions for further reading of historical narratives and lay the foundations for a future in which inclusivity is not a distant imaginary but part of the world we surround ourselves with.
